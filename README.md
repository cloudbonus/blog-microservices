# Blog REST

## Overview

The Blog is a sample application created as an interactive platform for IT students.
Authorized users can leave reactions and write comments.
Both students and company representatives can publish posts, but company representatives,
acting as ambassadors, cannot create posts freely; they must purchase them (e.g., a post about internship recruitment).

When a company representative creates a post, an order is automatically generated.
The post will not be publicly visible until the order is paid.
The application includes validation and allows users to leave reactions on posts or comments,
as well as create comments.

User verification is also present to assign roles as either a student or a company representative.
The application uses Spring Security to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
It also supports pagination, making it easy to navigate through large amounts of data.

### Pagination and Sorting examples
   
```console  
http://localhost:8080/user
http://localhost:8080/user?pageSize=2
http://localhost:8080/user?pageSize=2&pageNumber=2
http://localhost:8080/user?pageSize=2&pageNumber=2orderBy=asc
```
